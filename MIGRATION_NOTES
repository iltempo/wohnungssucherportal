  Old router API
  The router API has totally changed.
  More information: http://yehudakatz.com/2009/12/26/the-rails-3-router-rack-it-up/

  The culprits: 
  	- config/routes.rb

  Deprecated test_help path
  You now must require 'rails/test_help' not just 'test_help'.
  More information: http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/9/1/gem-packaging-best-practices

  The culprits: 
  	- test/test_helper.rb.rails2

  Deprecated ERb helper calls
  Block helpers that use concat (e.g., form_for) should use <%= instead of <%.  The current form will continue to work for now, but you will get deprecation warnings since this form will go away in the future.
  More information: http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/
  (applies to all helpers that take blocks, like javascript_tag ... do as well)
  
  The culprits: 
  	- app/views/flats/index.html.erb
  	- app/views/flats/edit.html.erb
  	- app/views/flats/new.html.erb
  	- app/views/flats/prefill_url_form.html.erb

  named_scope is now just scope
  The named_scope method has been renamed to just scope.
  More information: http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/d60bb0a9e4be2ac0a9de9a69041a4ddc2e0cc914

  The culprits: 
  	- app/models/flat.rb

* rake rails:upgrade:backup

* "Note that Ruby 1.8.7 p248 and p249 have marshaling bugs that crash Rails 3.0."
  => upgrade to Ruby 1.9.2 or 1.8.7 p 302+

* change Rails gem version to 3.0.9

* rails .
  => merge files
  
* upgrade routes to rails 3 syntax

* undefined method `generate_best_match=' for ActionDispatch::Routing:Module
  => delete file as these are defaults in Rails 3.

* strings output in templates are now html escaped by default.
  => mark all strings that should not be escaped with .html_safe

* remove preinitializer
  only needed in Rails 2.3 w bundler
  
* destroy geht nicht
  => link_to mit :confirm war verwendet, das UJS brauchte.
  rails.js war nicht includiert; done, done.

* create geht nicht
  No route matches "/flats/new"
  => Rails wollte POST auf den pfad machen, das geht nicht. umstellen auf get:
  form_tag(url_for_options = {}, options = {}
  => form_tag({:action => 'new'}, {:method => :get}) 

* uninitialized class variable @@scraper_registry in PageScraper
  => needed to load special page scrapers by hand (initializer), since Rails does not look them up directly 
  and therefore const_missing doesn't kick in to autoload them.

* clean up script/*
